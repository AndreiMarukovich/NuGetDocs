# Hosting Packages Overview

Some companies restrict which third-party libraries their developers may use. Therefore, they might not want developers to have access to everything in the official NuGet feed, or they might have a set of proprietary libraries they want to make available in addition to the official feed.

In these scenarios, you can set up a custom NuGet feed, and you can configure Visual Studio to offer that feed instead of or in addition to the official feed. A feed can be local (a folder on the local machine or a network folder), or remote (an intranet or internet URL).

There are are 3 main solutions from the NuGet team to store and retrieve NuGet packages

- Local Feeds

- NuGet.Server

- NuGet Gallery
