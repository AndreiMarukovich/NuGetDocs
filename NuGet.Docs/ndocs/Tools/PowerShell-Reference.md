# PowerShell Reference

The Package Manager Console is a PowerShell console within Visual Studio used to interact with NuGet and 
automate Visual Studio. The [Install Guide]() gives you an overview of the various ways to acquire the NuGet Extension in Visual Studio that has support for the Package Manager Console if its not already available in the version you are using.

<div class="block-callout-info">

    Note that for more detailed help, you can run the <code>Get-Help CommandName</code> 
    from within the NuGet Package Manager Console in Visual Studio.
