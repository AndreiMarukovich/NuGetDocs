#Publish a Package

Before you publish your package, you must decide whether you want your package to be public or private.

* If it's for public consumption, use [NuGet.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/manage/upload).
* If it's within an organization or a team, use one of the following methods:
    * NuGet.Server or file shares (for more information, see [Hosting Packages Overview](/ndocs/host-packages/hosting-packages-overview))
	* Visual Studio Team Services Package Management
	* Other third-party package repository managers, such as myget, ProGet, Nexus Repository, Artifactory, etc.

##Create an account
To publish to [NuGet.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/upload) you must have an account.

###Using the push command

In a command prompt, run the following command:

	nuget set ApiKey Your-API-Key

This will store your API key on the machine so that you will not need to do this step again on the same machine.

Push your package to NuGet Gallery using the command:

	nuget push YourPackage.nupkg
